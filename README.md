The colour theme of this site is as follows: 

|Colour|Hex Code|Description   |
|:-----|:-------|:-------------|
|Pine  |#234F1E |Primary Colour|
|Parchment|#F1E9D2 |Primary Background Colour|
|Celadon|#699E63 |Secondary Colour|

There are two fonts used through these sites:

## Testing

## Bugs

1. flipping cards on restaurant and bar tab kept overlapping on small screens - fixed by changing the height to an absolute px value using developer tools testing until the correct height was found

## Deployment

## Code Used From External Sauces
For the cards on the restaurant and bar pages, I used code from W3Schools which can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp) to cause the responsive flipping.
